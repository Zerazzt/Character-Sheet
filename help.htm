<h1>Character Generator: User Manual</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>This program is designed as an alternative for a character sheet in role-playing games. It is not a substitute for knowing what the features of your characters do, nor for knowing how the game is played or how the mechanics work. It is merely providing a digital platform on which you can create, save, and load your character.<br>This manual is designed to help with the use of this program, not to teach users how to play role-playing games. For that information, please see the appropriate resource for the game you are playing.<br>This program was created privately without any association to any companies responsible for the creation and designing of role-playing games. It is not to be distributed under any circumstances for monetary gains. This program was created using the CppCLR_Winforms_Projekt extension for Visual Studio 2019.</p>

<h2>Installing the Character Generator</h2>
<p>To install the program, run “installer.exe” and go through the steps as instructed by the installation wizard. It will be saved to the program files folder for the current user.</p>

<h2>Using the Character Generator</h2>

<h3>Data</h3>

<h4>Top Bar Information</h4>
<p>Along the top bar, several pieces of information are stored. The name, level, background, alignment, class, subclass, race, and subrace of the character are all found here. The name of the character is entered as text. This information is used to store and lore your character. The level of your character is stored as a numeric value (i.e. 1, 5, 20, not “one”, “five”, or “twenty”). This is used to calculate your proficiency bonus. Your race and class are selected from dropdown menus and determine what features your character has.</p>

<h4>Ability Scores</h4>
<p>Along the left side of the application are six numbers. These represent your ability scores (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma). These numbers are changed in the same manner as your level is (explained under Top Bar Information). How high or low these scores are determines your ability modifier for that score (the number that is not manually changeable immediately below the ability score numbers), which is used for saving throws and skills (explained in the next section).</p>

<h4>Saving Throws and Skills</h4>
<p>Both saving throws and skills are related to one ability score each. By clicking on the box to the left of the saving throw/skill’s name, you toggle whether or not your character is considered proficient in that skill. Whether or not you are proficient in a saving throw/skill determines—along with your ability score modifier—what you modify your roll by when you roll a d20 for that particular event.</p>

<h4>Feats</h4>
<p>At certain points in the game, you may have the option of acquiring a feat for your character. This textbox is where that information, as well as any additional features your character may have outside of those determined by your background, class, and race, should be stored.</p>

<h4>Equipment and Money</h4>
<p>Next to the skills, there are five more numeric values. There represent how many coins of various values your character has in their possession. Next to this is a textbox where you can enter what pieces of equipment your character has acquired.</p>

<h4>Features and Traits</h4>
<p>Based on your background, class, and race, your character will have certain features. These are displayed here. The data presented here is not directly editable by the user; it comes from the data files for that background/class/race.</p>

<h4>Spell Slots</h4>
<p>Depending on your class, you may have spell slots of various levels. Here you can save how many spell slots of each level you have in total, as well as how many you’ve already used. This information does modify in any way other aspects of the character but is, however, saved along with the rest of the character.</p>

<h4>Spells Known</h4>
<p>Like the feats section, here you can save what spells your character knows.</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<h4>Randomizing Your Character</h4>
<p>To randomize part of your character, click on the button that says it will randomize that part. For example, to be given a random class and subclass, click on “Randomize Class”. These buttons are located in the top bar on the right side. Clicking randomize all will select a random for each of the dropdown menus also located in the top bar.<br>To roll for random ability scores, click the “Roll Ability Scores” button. This uses the standard of rolling 4d6 and ignoring the lowest roll. The Character Generator does not take into consideration racial bonuses to ability scores.</p>

<h4>Saving Characters</h4>
<p>To save all aspects of your character, type the name of the character in the name field and then press “Save”. This will store all the information you have entered for your character where the Character Generator can access them later.</p>

<h4>Loading Characters</h4>
<p>In order to access a previously saved character, type the name of the character you wish to load into the name field, and then press “Load”. This will replace all data currently displayed with the data stored in that character. It is important to note that this is case-sensitive and trying to load a character that does not exist may cause the program to crash.</p>

<h4>Rolling Dice</h4>
<p>Below the spell slot data, there are options for rolling various dice. To use these, simply press the “Roll” button to the right of the die you wish to roll, and the result will appear to the right of the button. The first seven options are in the standard notation where d4 means a four-sided die, d6 means a six-sided die, and so on. To use the final option, first enter how many sides the die should have. Upon pressing roll, a random number between one and the value you entered (inclusive) will be generated.</p>

<h1>Modifying the Character Generator Data</h1>
<p>All the data for the Character Generator is stored in text files. If you wish to add or remove certain options or features, simply go to the location where the Character Generator was installed, enter the Data folder, then Input folder and then you will have access to all the files from which the program reads its information. So long as the format of the files, file names, and data within the files is maintained, the Character Generator will continue to run. Relaunching may be required to update the options shown.<br>Note that if you modify the data such that the Character Generator cannot access critical files, it will not run, and you may need to reinstall the program and its dependencies.</p>
